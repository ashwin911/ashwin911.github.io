I did it. I've finished development on Kicking Balls and submitted the binary to the AppStore. At the moment it is still waiting to be reviewed by the guys in Cupertino and will be released as soon as the reviewers give their OK. However I can't sit back and relax, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. I need to create a teaser trailer and a release trailer, this website needs improvement and a landing page for the game is still on the to do list.  

I also have to do testing for the Android version. Good thing I've developed it in Unity, my Java skills are terrible. And after that I need to start working on new levels for the game. It can be quite overwhelming sometimes but that's the life of a solo indie dev. The path I have chosen and I love it.
